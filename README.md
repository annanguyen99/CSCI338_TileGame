# CSCI338_TileGame
The 8- tile puzzle consists of an area divided into a 3x3 grid. On each grid square is a tile, expect for one 
square which remains empty (blank). Thus, there are eight tiles in the 8-puzzle. A tile that is next to the 
blank square can be moved into the empty space, leaving its previous position empty in turn. Tiles are 
numbered, 1 thru 8 for the 8-puzzle, so that each tile can be uniquely identified. The aim of the puzzle is 
to achieve a given configuration of tiles from a given (different) configuration by sliding the individual tiles 
around the grid as described above.
